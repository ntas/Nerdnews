== Nerdnews

Inspired by the now defunct http://doggdot.us, this is a feed aggregator of Digg, Slashdot & Delicious (and a few 
others).

New feeds can be added to the site by editing config/feed_urls.yml. Just add a name, and a URL and feedtools will 
automatically find the feed links.

To update the feeds, add a cronjob to your server poll the feeds for new items. I have a half-hourly update running on 
http://nerdnews.tjl2.com as follows:

04,34 * * * * root cd /path/to/current; rails runner -e production 'RssItem.update_feeds'
